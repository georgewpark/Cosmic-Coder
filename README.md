**Cosmic Coder** is a game-based learning environment developed to assist in research for an honours project dissertation. The game is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using an HTML5 game framework called Phaser. It aims to teach core programming concepts by presenting the player with a number of problems/puzzles in which they have to correctly input code in order to progress. There are 7 levels in the game, each of which target the teaching of a specific programming concept and then enable the player to demonstrate their knowledge of this concept. The game takes an object-orientated approach to teaching programming. The programming concepts covered in the game include: objects, conditionals, functions/methods, arrays, loops, classes, and OOP concepts.
